# CoronavirusEDA
This repository is my Coronavirus EDA 

The purpose of this project was to see if there was a correlation between virus containment and testing. The data that is being analysed is the “our world in data” coronavirus csv. 
The data was cleaned and visualised using pandas, numpy and matplotlib in a Jupyter notebook. 
The main findings of the analysis can be found in the EDA pdf.
